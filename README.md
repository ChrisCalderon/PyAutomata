PyAutomata
==========

A simple Python module for generating cellular automata.

running the script will create a directory called `png` which will contain a largish png of each of the 256 cellular automata rules. You can change the number of rows and the scalling factor by changing the arguments to the `make_pngs` function at the bottom of the script.
